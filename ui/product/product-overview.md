# Sanjana's Portfolio

## Description
A strategic portfolio that serves as a mutual pre-qualification tool and compelling showcase. It helps both parties—employer and candidate—assess compatibility before investing time in a conversation, while demonstrating end-to-end product and technical thinking with precision.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Wasted Discovery Calls for Both Sides
Clear signals upfront help misaligned parties recognize it early, saving everyone time.

### Problem 2: Difficulty Conveying End-to-End Skills
Case studies demonstrate the full arc from product thinking to technical execution, not just final outputs.

### Problem 3: Generic Portfolios Don't Enable Decision-Making
A focused, intentional structure answers "Should we talk?" for both parties, not just "Look what I made."

### Problem 4: Mutual Fit is Hard to Assess Before a Call
Transparent preferences about work style, values, and project types help both sides recognize alignment—or gracefully move on.
