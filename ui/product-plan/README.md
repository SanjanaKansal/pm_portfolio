# Sanjana's Portfolio — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement Sanjana's Portfolio.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined
- `instructions/incremental/` — 5 milestone instructions (foundation + 4 sections)

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, tokens
- `data-model/` — Entity types and sample data
- `shell/` — Application shell components
- `sections/` — 4 section component packages with test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`)
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
4. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
5. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green
