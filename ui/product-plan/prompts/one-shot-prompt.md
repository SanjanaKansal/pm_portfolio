# One-Shot Implementation Prompt

I need you to implement a complete portfolio web application based on detailed design specifications and UI components I'm providing.

## Instructions

Please carefully read and analyze the following files:

1. **@product-plan/product-overview.md** — Product summary with sections and data model overview
2. **@product-plan/instructions/one-shot-instructions.md** — Complete implementation instructions for all milestones

After reading these, also review:
- **@product-plan/design-system/** — Color and typography tokens
- **@product-plan/data-model/** — Entity types and relationships
- **@product-plan/shell/** — Application shell components
- **@product-plan/sections/** — All section components, types, sample data, and test instructions

## Before You Begin

Please ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **Hosting & Deployment**
   - Where should this be deployed? (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.)
   - Any custom domain requirements?

2. **Tech Stack Preferences**
   - What frontend framework? (React, Next.js, etc.)
   - Any specific hosting/deployment requirements?

3. **Customization**
   - Any changes to the provided content?
   - Additional sections or features needed?

4. **Any Other Clarifications**
   - Questions about specific features or user flows
   - Integration requirements (analytics, etc.)

Lastly, be sure to ask me if I have any other notes social to add for this implementation.

Once I answer your questions, create a comprehensive implementation plan before coding.
